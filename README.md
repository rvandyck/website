# Sample Website

This is a sample website made as part of the projects for the course Learn [*Learn Enough Git To Be Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/git), the best intro to Git course that I have come across. Be sure to [join the email list](http://learnenough.com/#email_list) and [follow @learnenough](http://twitter.com/learnenough) on Twitter.

After finishing *Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous*, you'll know enough Git to be *dangerous*. This means you'll be able to use Git to track changes in your projects, back up data, share your work with others, and collaborate with programmers and other users of Git.
